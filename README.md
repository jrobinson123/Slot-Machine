# Slot-Machine
This is my virtual 5 by 3 slot. Once the slot starts each symbol goes cycling through different positions in the reel until it reaches its destination. There is an exponential decrease in speed as the symbol approaches its destination. There is also a bounce at the very end of each cycle. Though the exact timing varies on each trial, the first reel will finish first, the second reel will finish second and so on. Each of the 8 symbol has an equal chance of being chosen so there are 8^5 = 32,768 possibilites.
